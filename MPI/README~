This is a C++ code written with Message Passing Interface (MPI) API.
Its function is to implement phase field simulation mainly for Austenite/Ferrite phase transformations.
The employed phase field model is developed by Ingo Steinbach et al. The details of the model can be found in " Eiken et al., Applied Physics (E), 2004".
The model basically consists of a system of partial differential equations (PDEs). The PDEs are basically diffusion-advection types.
Explict finite difference scheme is used to solve the equations numerically. On each grid point,about 5-10 PDE are solved,thus the computation is intensive.
The boundary conditions are periodic in all directions.

Two input files are required: 1) log_file1.txt 2) thermo_data.txt.
The "log_file1.txt" file is the main file consisting of the simulation parameters, e.g. domain size. The main file also indicates the name of the thermodyanamics file, i.e. thermo_data.txt in the example (see in the example subdirectory).
The code uses Blitz++ package for multidimensional arrays. Therefore, pre-installation of Blitz++ is required. It can be downloaded from www.sourceforge.net.
The code uses 2D/3D Cartensian Topology to decompose the 2D/3D computational domain into subdomains. Since 5-stencil scheme is used, one layer of halo cells is required to be exchanged between neighboring processes.
Non-blocking inter-process communications are used for halo-data exchange.

Please make necessary change of the makefile:
1) the compiler name (mpic++ by default);
2) the Include path for Blitz++ package, e.g. /usr/lib/blitz-10.0.1;
3) the compilation options, for either debug or release version  (see details in the makefile).

The code can also be compiled to be a MPI/OpenMP hybrid program by enabling the -fopenmp option in the makefile. 


Anyone can use the code for research or further development. For any problem, please contact zhubenqiang@gmail.com.
