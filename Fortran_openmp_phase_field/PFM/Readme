This is a FORTRAN code implementing phase field simulation of intercritical annealing.
The program can be run on a multi-core shared-memory system including cc-NUMA systems.

File structure:
\PFM
   |
   |_\bin    /* binary executable 
   |
   |_\obj    /* object and module files generated during compilation
   |
   |_\src    /* source code *.f90 
   |
   |_\example /* example input files
   |
   |_\doc     /* introduction of the phase field model and numerical algorithms
   |
   |_makefile 
   |
   |_Readme
   
Compilation:
 the compiler by default is intel fortran (ifort). You may use other compilers, e.g. gfortran. But you need to modify the compilation optiongs in the makefile.

Run program:
 there are two input files as shown in \example. One is the main input file and the other is the stored energy distribution file.
 The path and name of the stored energy distribution file should be consistent with the path and name indicated in the main input file.
 To run the program PFM, just type ./PFM name_of_main_input_file
